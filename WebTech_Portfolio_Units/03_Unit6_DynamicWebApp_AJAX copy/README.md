# Unit 6 – Dynamic Web Application (AJAX + Server Endpoint)

## Objective
Build a dynamic web application with client-side validation, AJAX submission, and server-side processing.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the `client/` folder and open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Ensure the server-side endpoint is running in a JSP/ASP-compatible server.
3. Submit the form and observe the dynamic updates.

## What to Screenshot
1. Form validation error message.
2. Successful form submission.
3. Dynamically updated list showing the submitted item.

## Known Limitations
- The server-side endpoint is a stub and does not persist data.
- Ensure the server supports JSP for the endpoint to function.
