Web Technologies Portfolio – README
Project Overview

This project represents a comprehensive Web Technologies portfolio developed as part of an academic assessment. The portfolio demonstrates both practical technical skills and reflective learning across core web development concepts, including semantic HTML, responsive CSS design, JavaScript interactivity, multimedia integration, and foundational server-side awareness. The work is structured to meet professional web development standards while also fulfilling academic assessment criteria.

Assessment Structure

The assessment is divided into two main components: Part A (Final Portfolio Website) and Part B (Weekly Evidence and Reflection).

Part A consists of a fully functional portfolio website with a central navigation system linking to six independently coded units. Each unit showcases specific technical implementations and applies best practices in usability, responsiveness, code organisation, and maintainability. The website is designed to be accessible, readable, and professionally presented across multiple devices.

Part B includes structured weekly PDF reports that document learning progress throughout the module. These reports contain screenshots demonstrating implemented functionality and reflective commentary on completed tasks, challenges faced, and learning outcomes achieved.

Technical Implementation
HTML and Semantic Foundations

The portfolio makes consistent use of semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>. This ensures a clear content hierarchy, improved accessibility for screen readers, and easier long-term maintenance. Semantic principles are applied across early units, including the personal profile, and carried through to the final portfolio pages.

CSS and Responsive Design

A centralised CSS file is used to maintain consistent typography, spacing, alignment, and visual hierarchy throughout the site. Responsive design techniques, including flexible containers and media queries, allow the layout and navigation to adapt smoothly to different screen sizes. Design decisions prioritise readability, professional appearance, and reduced cognitive load rather than excessive visual complexity.

JavaScript and Interactivity

JavaScript enhances functionality without compromising performance. Interactive features include responsive navigation behaviour, dynamic content updates, and client-side form validation. Validation provides immediate user feedback and improves usability. The project explicitly acknowledges the limitations of client-side validation and recognises that secure, real-world systems require server-side controls.

Multimedia Integration

HTML5 multimedia elements are integrated selectively, including <video> for local playback, <audio> for embedded sound, and image galleries for visual content. Media is used to support engagement and portfolio presentation while remaining mindful of performance, load times, and device constraints.

Testing and Reliability

Manual testing was conducted across multiple modern browsers. Responsiveness was verified using developer tools and simulated mobile and tablet viewports. Forms were tested using invalid inputs and edge cases. Debugging relied on browser console tools and incremental code refinement. While effective for this project, limitations are acknowledged due to the absence of automated and server-side testing.

Learning Outcomes and Reflection

The project demonstrates clear progression from static HTML to dynamic and responsive web systems. Key learning outcomes include improved debugging skills, iterative problem-solving, increased awareness of accessibility and usability, and a foundational understanding of security limitations. Overall, the portfolio aligns with professional web development practices and reflects sustained academic and technical growth.
